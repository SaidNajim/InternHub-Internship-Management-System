## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Java with Spring Boot**: We used Spring Boot for rapid development and easy configuration of our RESTful API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen as the relational database management system.

### Frontend
- **React**: Utilizing React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Axios**: Employed for making HTTP requests from React to the backend API.

### Version Control and Collaboration
- **Git**: For distributed version control.
- **GitHub**: Hosting our repository and facilitating team collaboration.

## System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and backend:

1. **Frontend (React)**: Handles the user interface and client-side logic.
2. **Backend (Spring Boot)**: Manages the business logic and data persistence.
3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores all system data based on the designed data model.

## Key Features

- Student internship application submission
- Professor supervision assignment
- Administrative oversight and validation
- Internship status tracking
